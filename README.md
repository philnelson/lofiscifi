# LOFI SCIFI

[LOFI SCIFI](http://retrostrange.com) is a 24/7 streaming radio station built with [liquidsoap](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap), [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), and several python and shell scripts. The station plays resiliant ogg and mp3 feeds. It mostly sources audio from [The Internet Archive's Old Time Radio](https://archive.org/details/oldtimeradio) section.

The project also includes a very fast, standards-based HTML5 web player in the [web/](https://github.com/philnelson/lofiscifi/tree/master/web) directory that looks great on any browser and practically any device.

Development and server costs for LOFI SCIFI are paid for by generous [Patreon subscribers](https://www.patreon.com/philnelson) and one-time tips from awesome people like you.
